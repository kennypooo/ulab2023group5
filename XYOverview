"""This is a more specific overview of how to use the XY code for our project!

There are pretty much x functions you need to know to actually get some good data. 
The thing is, the tutorial only really goes through like 2 or 3 of them, and its 
aimed at people with way more knowledge than us.

The first, most important thing to know is how to create a system. The XY_model.py 
file literally contains just a single class called XYSystem. As such, you can use it to create 
a spin lattice. you do this by calling first,"""

"""This creates the XYSystem, and has the spin configurations we want to mess with
 (inputs are temperature and width, which are kind of self-explanatory). 
 If you want to show a raw system without anything done to it, call"""

"""Now let's perform some operations on the system. The first thing is to let the system solve into a 
equilibrated state. This can be done using the built-in equilibrate function"""

"""All you have to decide is if you want the computer to show you the intermediate lattices in between
your originally-generated and equilibrated system. The next function to learn is the annealing function
This is the most important one. The annealing function takes a start and stop temperature, and shows the
equilibrated states in between the two temperatures"""
